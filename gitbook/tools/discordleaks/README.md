## Description

Unicorn Riot is a non-profit media organization in the United States. In the course of its reporting on hate groups and extremist networks, Unicorn Riot’s reporters have collected Discord, Rocket.Chat, and Skype chat logs—often by monitoring or infiltrating private servers—and made them publicly accessible for journalistic and research purposes. The “DiscordLeaks” web app allows the public to browse, search, and investigate these leaked chat logs, primarily focusing on far-right groups.

## Key Use Cases and Features:

1. Browsing Leaked Chat Logs
   * Users can navigate individual servers, channels, or participants within the archive.
   * Logs span multiple platforms (Discord, Rocket.Chat, Skype), with Discord being the primary focus.
2. Searching and Filtering
   * The site provides search capabilities for specific usernames, keywords, or phrases.
   * Basic and advanced search modes help narrow down results by date range or server.
3. Investigation of Far-Right Networks
   * The logs often reveal organizational details, ideological discussions, and events planning.
   * Researchers and journalists can identify patterns and connections between groups or individuals.
4. Public Access to Primary Source Material
   * Allows open scrutiny of communications that have historically been private.
   * Encourages transparency about hate-speech activities and extremist discourse.

### When/Why a Researcher or Journalist Might Use DiscordLeaks:

1. Documenting Extremist Organizing:
   * Example: A journalist investigating a local protest or rally might discover planning details in the leaked chat logs.
   * Outcome: Gaining insight into the coordination, participants, and strategies of hate or extremist groups.
2. Tracking Cross-Platform Activities:
   * Example: A researcher might compare chat discussions on Discord with related user accounts on other social platforms.
   * Outcome: Revealing how certain narratives or calls to action propagate across platforms.
3. Verifying Claims or Rumors:
   * Example: A public figure is rumored to have participated in a far-right server chat. A search might confirm or disprove it.
   * Outcome: Fact-checking direct quotes or involvement in extremist communications.
4. Studying Group Dynamics and Radicalization:
   * Example: An academic researcher could analyze the text content of logs to see how extremist language evolves over time.
   * Outcome: Identifying shifts in rhetoric, recruitment strategies, or new ideological trends.

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>

* Beginner-Friendly (Web Browser Usage)

* Moderate for In-Depth Research
  * Large-scale text analysis, cross-referencing multiple users or servers, and systematic data collection may require more advanced skills.

## Requirements

* A modern web browser.
* Stable internet connection.

## Limitations

* Partial Coverage: This is not a comprehensive archive of all Discord servers, or even all far-right servers. It only includes servers that Unicorn Riot’s team had access to.
* Potential Data Gaps: Some servers or channels might have been deleted or not fully logged, leading to incomplete archives.
* Relevance: The data can be most useful to those who already know the group, channel, or user they’re investigating.
* Unverified Accuracy: Logs are presented as-is. Names, time stamps, or content may be incomplete or contain disinformation.

## Ethical Considerations

* Infiltration and Privacy: The content originates from private servers that were accessed through journalistic or infiltration methods. Though published publicly, it may include sensitive or personal information.
* Content Sensitivity: Chat logs may contain hate speech, extremist rhetoric, or graphic content. Users should proceed with caution.
* Legal and Ethical Use: If referencing this material in publications or research, verify the context and consider potential legal implications. Always handle personal data responsibly.
