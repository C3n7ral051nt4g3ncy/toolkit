## Description

The main objective of Atlos is to enable a team of investigators to collaborate easily, even in large-scale investigations. The investigation has to be divided into several cases called ‘incidents’.

You can then, on a single page:

* create and characterise each case
* alert everyone to the sensitivity of the footage before it is reached
* collect digital material such as photos, videos and PDFs from all over the Internet
* ... and archive it automatically
* see material displayed in default greyscale, or colour
* organise who is assigned or will receive updates on a case
* work on it simultaneously&#x20;
* .... and transparently (no comments written on ATLOS can be deleted later, so the whole investigation process is recorded)
* specify the GPS coordinates and find the incident on a map
* analyse the progress of your investigation

This platform is open source (see [https://github.com/atlosdotorg/atlos](./#url)), and you can:

* use it on the Internet or host it yourself
* import and export your data in CSV format
* create custom integrations, for example with third-party archiving and publishing tools

## Limitations

If your investigation is small-scale, a spreadsheet may suffice.

And on ATLOS, if you want to archive a document, put it in Source Material, not in comments where only the text and URLs are saved.

## Ethical Considerations

Take a look at their security and risk model, available here: [https://docs.atlos.org/safety-and-security/risk-model/](https://docs.atlos.org/safety-and-security/risk-model/)&#x20;

Your use cases may not yet have been encountered by their team, so if you feel the need to, you can contact the team by e-mail.

Nevertheless, note that, according to their main page, 'while Atlos' archival function supports journalistic investigations, it’s not suitable for legal or forensic evidence.'
