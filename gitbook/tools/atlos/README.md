## Description

The main objective of Atlos is to enable teams of investigators to collaborate easily, even on large-scale investigations. Investigations can be divided into several cases called ‘incidents’.

You can, on a single page:

* create and characterise each case;
* alert everyone to the sensitivity of the footage before it is reached;
* collect digital material such as photos, videos and PDFs from all over the Internet;
* ... and archive it automatically;

* see material displayed in default greyscale (to prevent [vicarious trauma](https://docs.atlos.org/safety-and-security/vicarious-trauma/)), or colour;
* organise who is assigned to a case or will receive updates on it;
* work on the case simultaneously
* .... and transparently (no comments written on ATLOS can be deleted later, so the whole investigation process is recorded);
* specify the GPS coordinates and find the incident on a map;
* analyse the progress of your investigation.

This platform is open source (see [https://github.com/atlosdotorg/atlos](./#url)), and you can:

* use it on the Internet or [host it yourself](https://docs.atlos.org/technical/self-hosting/);
* [import and export](https://docs.atlos.org/investigations/import-and-export-data/) your data in CSV format;
* create custom integrations, for example with third-party archiving and publishing tools.

## Limitations

If your investigation is small-scale, a spreadsheet may suffice.

If you want to archive a document while working on Atlos, put it in the Source Material category, not in the comments, otherwise only the text and URL are saved.

Your use cases may not yet have been encountered by their team, so if you feel the platform does not meet your needs, you can contact the team vis e-mail.

Note that the tool providers have clarified that, 'while Atlos' archival function supports journalistic investigations, it’s not suitable for legal or forensic evidence.'

## Ethical Considerations

Take a look at the Atlos security and risk model which is available here: [https://docs.atlos.org/safety-and-security/risk-model/](https://docs.atlos.org/safety-and-security/risk-model/).&#x20;
