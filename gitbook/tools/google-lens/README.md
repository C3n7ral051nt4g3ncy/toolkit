## Description

Use Google Lens to identify objects or locations that are visible in an image. This can be useful if you want to geolocate an image, or find out more information about the objects, landmarks or vegetation in a photograph in order to better understand its contents. Primarily a mobile phone application, it can also be used in the Chrome browser.&#x20;

### Using the Google Photos mobile application&#x20;

Open a photograph in the [Google Photos](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos) mobile application and click the Google Lens![](<.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)  icon at the bottom of the image. The app will highlight a specific part of the image in a rectangle, which you can move by dragging, or re-size using one of the corners, to make sure it captures your specific area or object of interest.

## Requirements

You need the [Google Photos](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos) application on your mobile phone if you want to search an image in your gallery. Otherwise, you can use Google Lens with Google Chrome.

## Limitations

Google Lens is getting more sophisticated with time, but it doesn't always work, especially with landmarks or objects that are less well-known or common. It is, however, a very useful first port of call and can potentially save you time.

## Ethical Considerations

Make sure you analyse the search results critically and cross-reference these with other sources of information to ensure you draw the right conclusions and your findings are accurate. Do not use copyright images without permission.&#x20;
