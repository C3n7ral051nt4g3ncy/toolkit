## Description

Skopenow is a tool for consolidating information related to social media usernames, previous addresses, corporation information, darkweb leaks, and vehicle information related to targets being investigated. Skopenow also has a subscription option for their [Grid product](https://www.skopenow.com/grid), which provides users with location based alerts for news, emergency services, traffic cams, and scheduled events.

Reports generated from the system forensically capture screen captures, metadata, and hash data from the original sources without users having to log in to any social media accounts.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

For individual and corporation searches, the tool requires a name and at least one other piece of identifiable information (ie, social media username, phone number, email, address, city, etc.). Paid accounts also require vetting by Skopenow personnel.

## Limitations

Data returned is limited to publicly available information, and requires a fair amount of due diligence before being included in a final report. The best way to work with this tool is to think of it as a centralized search engine across several different methodologies (public records, dark web leaks, social media platforms) that allows you to exclude results as you investigate them further.

## Ethical Considerations

While all of the information collected in a report is publicly available in some way, reports on individuals do paint a fairly comprehensive picture of their personal information. This information must be used and shared responsibly.

## Guide

Skopenow hosts a free ongoing [webinar series](https://www.skopenow.com/skopenow-webinar-series) that provides instructions on how to use various features of the product, as well as how the product intersects with different investigative methodologies.

On the company website, there are also a series of [guides and reports](https://www.skopenow.com/guides-and-reports) related to OSINT methodologies that are free to access.

## Tool provider
