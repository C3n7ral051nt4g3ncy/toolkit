Current version: 7.0.11 (Jan 2025)

## Description

Zotero is a reference management tool for Mac, Windows, Linux, and iOS that helps users collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research materials. It automatically captures research items from web pages, supports tagging and organizing items into collections, and integrates with word processors for easy citation management. Zotero also offers cloud syncing across devices and collaborative features for shared research projects.

**These examples assume you have made a free account and installed Zotero and the browser plugin on your system.**&#x20;

### Citing and archiving sources&#x20;

Academic papers are what this software was intended for, but it also works for archiving almost any other content. Zotero can archive various kinds of content. Naturally, PDFs are supported, but depending on what you're looking at, you can make snapshots of websites, attach data files, source code, or basically any other sort of file.&#x20;

Say we found an exciting-sounding article we want to cite in our paper. And we love to give credit (also, citing sources isn't optional).

#### Phase A - Research

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

To clarify, we're the sleuths in that scenario. But wait, doesn't that sound familiar?

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Oh, it's a review of that book we've read. &#x20;

#### Phase B - Archiving

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Sleuths among you may have noticed that one icon in particular has changed. The Zotero icon has been changed from a folder to a paper. This means that Zotero has identified this as, you guessed it, a paper.

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

When you click the icon, you'll see identified metadata, you can select a folder to archive your paper in, and you notice that a full-text PDF is available and has conveniently already been attached to your entry.&#x20;

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Huzzah! Prolific researchers like us can't write about a review of the book without reading the book, though, can we? DEFINITELY good that we installed the browser plugin. It's totally possible to fill out these fields by hand.

#### Phase C - Indexing primary literature

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Oh, it was right there? Wait, but these lead to Google Books...

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Noticed something? Correct, Zotero knows we're looking at a page that contains book metadata.

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

And, obviously, we also grabbed the other one. Notice the Item Type change?

#### Phase D - Citing

OK, we're now at the point where we're starting to build an archive of books like Higgins (2021) or...

Higgins, E. (2021). _We Are Bellingcat: Global Crime, Online Sleuths, and the Bold Future of News_. Bloomsbury Publishing USA.

How to cite neatly and without effort? "Create Bibliography from Item" is one way.

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Depending on your field, preference, or journal, you pick a Citation Style. Many of you might pick Harvard, I'm more of an APA7 kinda guy. The above will create an in-text citation like (Higgins, 2021).

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (25).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

While this creates, you guessed it:

\
Sullivan, J. P. (2022). \[Review of _Review of We Are Bellingcat: Global Crime, Online Sleuths, and the Bold Future of News_, by E. Higgins]. _Journal of Strategic Security_, _15_(3), 138–141.

Now, you're ready to write your paper. A Word plugin exists:\

### Examples 2 ... n

**Works also on news articles.**&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Mind, though, that if you want an excellent screen capture to accompany your reference, you'll need to scroll down after clicking the icon or wait a couple of seconds, depending on whether or not the content is dynamically generated. Just wait or scroll until the "Snapshot" is not greyed out anymore.

Oh, and if you select multiple entries, the bibliography will also contain multiple references:

Here, you also see that it sometimes doesn't work correctly. You can go back to the software and change things manually very easily, though.&#x20;

### Zotero as archive tool & the Berkeley Protocol

Proper documentation is essential if the material is used in legal, academic, or policy advocacy contexts. [The Berkeley Protocol ](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2024-01/OHCHR_BerkeleyProtocol.pdf)outlines how OSINT data should be handled to be admissible in court (at least in the context of international proceedings).&#x20;

Using Zotero in this context is already a good start. Very few free tools allow archiving material in such an easy and automated way. Zotero allows you to save websites as a complete copy of the source code and a screenshot PDF. It also saves the date it was accessed and other metadata. Zotero stores all your research data locally by default, with syncing to the cloud disabled by default. If syncing is enabled, data is encrypted before leaving your computer and AES-256 encrypted at rest on Zotero's servers. Additionally, Zotero's data server is open-source, allowing you to run it locally for greater control over shared data.

However, there are a few significant limitations. First, Zotero does not encrypt your locally stored data or provide native password protection. Additionally, Zotero does not create or store hashes (a unique digital fingerprint) for archived material. This means Zotero cannot ensure the integrity of your data or prove that it has not been tampered with.

To address these issues, consider creating cryptographic hashes of downloaded material immediately upon archiving and storing them as supplemental data. Hashes calculated at the time of collection ensure that the data remains unaltered. Additionally, regular encrypted backups of your Zotero archive, with hashes for verification, can further secure your data. Exporting your Zotero library at regular intervals for secure storage is also recommended.

By implementing these measures, you can enhance Zotero's utility as an archiving tool and align its use more closely with evidentiary standards.
