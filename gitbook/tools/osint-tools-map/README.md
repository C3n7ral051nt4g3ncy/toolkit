## Limitations

The map is a directory and not a database. Some of the external databases may require a subscription or payment for full access. The page also doesnâ€™t show a date when it was last updated, so some site might go offline or change their access policies.

## Ethical Considerations

It is always important to keep an eye on local privacy regulations and ethical standards. Be aware that improper use of personal data from publicly available information may have legal implications.&#x20;
