## Description

ShipFinder is an application designed to track vessels in (near) real-time across the globe. It has a map-based interactive interface which allows users to search for vessels based on location, name MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identities), destination, IMO (International Maritime Organisation) number or callsign.&#x20;

The map-based layout allows users to zoom in and out to view vessel locations in specific areas or worldwide. The search function enables users to quickly find and track specific ships or ports. Fleetfinder acquires informs its map through the collection of AIS (Automatic Identification System) data. This is broadcast over radiowaves by ships and then picked up by either ShipFinder's own receivers or those belonging to the platform's partners.&#x20;

The app is available on both mobile and desktop platforms, ensuring users can monitor marine traffic from various devices.&#x20;

**Features**

1. **Real-Time Tracking**: The app provides (near) live tracking of ships, displaying their current positions, speed, and course. This feature is beneficial for open source researchers needing to monitor fleet movements or observing ship activities.
2. **Vessel Information**: ShipFinder includes detailed information about each vessel, such as its name, type, destination, and voyage history. This data is valuable for users looking to learn more about specific ships and their operations.
3. **Based on AIS Data**: The app leverages AIS data to provide accurate and up-to-date information. AIS data is infomation on ship movements and positions that is broadcast by the vessels themselves. This is picked up by coastal stations and relayed via the internet to ShipFinder. One drawback of this system is that when a ship is out of range of coastal receivers, data reception may be limited.&#x20;
4. **Past Vessel Movement**: ShipFinder's online and free versions allow users to playback a limited amount of a vessel's past movements. This feature gives a short term view of where a vessel has recently been and may be useful for analyzing shipping patterns, investigating incidents, or simply exploring the history of maritime activities.
5. [**Spotting Community**](https://my.pinkfroot.com/): The app also has an accompanying community page where members can post pictures of ships that they have spotted. These are often searchable by name or MMSI number.&#x20;
6. **Customizable Alerts**: Paid users can set up personalized alerts for specific vessels or areas. This feature keeps users informed about significant events, such as a ship's arrival at a port or changes in its route.

**Performance**

The app's performance has minimal lag even when tracking multiple vessels simultaneously.

## Limitations

* **Advanced Features**: Compared to other maritime tracking apps, ShipFinder might lack some advanced features like extensive filtering options and comprehensive vessel databases. Adding these features could enhance the app's utility for more professional users.
* **AIS Data**: ShipFinder's platform is based on AIS data. This means that if ships are broadcasting too far from a receiver that the platform has access to, it will be lacking data on that vessel. This can occur when a ship is too far from shore for a receiver to pick up its signals. It can also occur if the ship is in a remote area where ShipFinder does not have access to the data collected by a recieving station.&#x20;
* **Subscription Costs**: The premium version of the app, which offers additional features, may be considered expensive by some users. More flexible pricing plans or additional features in the free version could make the app more accessible.

## Ethical Considerations

Collating and analyzing data about specific vessels and their movements can potentially reveal sensitive information about individuals or organizations that was not intended to be public. This can raise privacy concerns. Make sure to use the tool responsibly and for research in the public interest&#x20;
