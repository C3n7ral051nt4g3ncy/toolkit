The map-based layout is intuitive, allowing users to zoom in and out effortlessly to view vessel locations in specific areas or worldwide. The search function is robust, enabling users to quickly find and track specific ships or ports.

The app is available on both mobile and desktop platforms, ensuring users can monitor marine traffic conveniently from various devices. The design is optimized for performance, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.

**Features**

1. **Real-Time Tracking**: The app provides live tracking of ships, displaying their current positions, speed, and course. This feature is beneficial for maritime professionals needing to monitor fleet movements or for enthusiasts interested in observing ship activities.
2. **Vessel Information**: ShipFinder includes detailed information about each vessel, such as its name, type, destination, and voyage history. This data is valuable for users looking to learn more about specific ships and their operations.
3. **AIS Data Integration**: The app leverages AIS (Automatic Identification System) data to provide accurate and up-to-date information. This integration ensures that users receive reliable data about ship movements and positions.
4. **Customizable Alerts**: Users can set up personalized alerts for specific vessels or areas. This feature keeps users informed about significant events, such as a ship's arrival at a port or changes in its route.
5. **Playback and Historical Data**: ShipFinder allows users to view historical data and playback past vessel movements. This feature is useful for analyzing shipping patterns, investigating incidents, or simply exploring the history of maritime activities.
6. **Weather Data**: The app integrates basic weather information, providing insights into sea conditions that could affect maritime operations. This feature helps users anticipate potential risks related to weather changes.
7. **Spotting Community**: The app also has an accompanying community page where members can post pictures of ships that they have spotted. These are often searchable by name or MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identities) number.&#x20;

The app's performance has minimal lag even when tracking multiple vessels simultaneously. The real-time updates are prompt, ensuring users have the most current information available.
