<summary><strong>CALL SIGNS: What are they? Why are they important? (CLICK TO EXPAND)</strong></summary>

**Definition:** [Call signs](https://skybrary.aero/articles/aircraft-call-sign) are used to identify specific flights/flight routes and for communication and identification in air traffic control. They are unique identifiers of an aircraft. They help differentiate each aircraft in the sky from one another. According to this [Bellingcat guide](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/10/15/a-beginners-guide-to-flight-tracking/), private aircraft often use their registration number as their call sign. In contrast, commercial flights usually have call signs based on their specific routes.

This[ GIJN guide](https://gijn.org/resource/planespotting-an-updated-guide-to-tracking-aircraft-around-the-world/) explains that “The call sign is more or less whatever the pilot decided to enter for that flight.” For commercial flights, on the other hand, it will be the flight number or close to it, like DAL307 for Delta Airlines flight 307 from Honolulu to Minneapolis.

Call signs also often vary with each flight, and occasionally, they may change even while in the air. For instance, an aircraft might have different call signs throughout the day if it completes several trips,[ Bellingcat explains](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/10/15/a-beginners-guide-to-flight-tracking/). Keep in mind that an aircraft can also have the [exact same call sign](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/russian-asset-tracker/faq-what-is-plane-tracking) in the span of a few days.&#x20;

**When to use call signs for open source investigations:** Call signs are helpful when monitoring routes and flight paths and identifying potential deviations or anomalies. It can tell you what the flight path of an aircraft is, its origin, its intended destination, and where it passes by. It is also helpful for flagging private aircraft that use their registration number as call signs.
