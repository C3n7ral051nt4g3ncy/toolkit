<summary><strong>REGISTRATION NUMBER/ TAIL NUMBER/ N-NUMBER: What is it? Why is it important?</strong> (CLICK TO EXPAND)</summary>

**Definition:** This number appears near the tail of every aircraft (see paragraph 6 in [this guide](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/10/15/a-beginners-guide-to-flight-tracking/)). This is sometimes called a “Tail Number” or, in the United States, an “N-Number”. It is a unique number that tells you which country the aircraft[ was registered](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/russian-asset-tracker/faq-what-is-plane-tracking). This[ guide](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/10/15/a-beginners-guide-to-flight-tracking/) specifies that an aircraft's registration is similar to a car's license plate, assigned when registered in a specific country. This registration reflects the jurisdiction of the aircraft according to this[ list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_registration_prefixes).

**When to use call signs for open source investigations:** If available, registration information can help find clues about ownership of the aircraft or, at the very least, in which country it is registered. However, there are a few caveats:

1:[ The registered owner is rarely the actual UBO](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/russian-asset-tracker/faq-what-is-plane-tracking) (Ultimate Beneficial Owner - the person who profits or benefits from a corporate entity). It is rarely an individual but a company, trust, or charter/leasing company. In these cases, use additional sources to combine different pieces of information.

2: Aircraft registration can change,[ especially when sold to a new owner.](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/10/15/a-beginners-guide-to-flight-tracking/)\
