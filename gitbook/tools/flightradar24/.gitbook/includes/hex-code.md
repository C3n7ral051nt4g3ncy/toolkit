**Definition:** A hex code is a unique ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) six-digit hexadecimal number assigned to an aircraft's transponder. This code serves as a digital identifier, allowing air traffic control and flight tracking systems to distinguish one aircraft from another (see p.3-4 of [this document](https://elearning.aljazeera.net/en/journalism-magazine/osint-tracking-ships-planes-and-weapons)). When the plane is registered, it gets a unique code[ called a hex code](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/russian-asset-tracker/faq-what-is-plane-tracking). This hex code is associated with the plane’s ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast)[ transponder](https://www.airservicesaustralia.com/about-us/projects/ads-b/how-ads-b-works/), which broadcasts unencrypted data about the plane’s position, altitude, and speed.

**When to use hex codes for open source investigations:** Hex codes are closely associated with a plane’s registration. Therefore, it is possible to determine ownership if that information is available. According to[ OCCRP's FAQ](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/russian-asset-tracker/faq-what-is-plane-tracking), “most flight tracking websites link the transponder codes to registration numbers to make sense of tracking data,” especially since aircraft do not usually broadcast registration numbers over their ADS-B transponder.&#x20;
