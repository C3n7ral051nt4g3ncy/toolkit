## Description

GeoSpy is an online platform that uses neural networks to estimate the geographic location of photographs by analyzing visual features such as vegetation, architectural styles, and contextual clues. Users can upload a photograph, and the tool will provide an estimated location of city, state, and country, a marker on a map of the location, a short block of text explaining its reasoning for choosing that location, and other potential similar locations that may match the photo.

Currently, you just need to upload an image file to the website, and no subscription or account creation is required for use. If you create a free account (either via email and password, or via your Google account), you will have access to additional features such as a history of previously searched photos, and the ability to upload and search up to six photos at once.

As with any AI model, results are not foolproof and should be further corroborated, but the tool can be useful for getting initial clues about an image's location.

## Ethical Considerations

GeoSpy's [Privacy Policy](https://api.geospy.ai/privacy-policy) specifies the extent and use of its data collection; the tool collects data that includes but is not limited to your IP address, browser information, details about your mobile device if accessing the tool via mobile, and more. This data may also be shared with Graylark's business partners, affiliates, and others.

GeoSpy's [API FAQs](https://api.geospy.ai/#faqs) specify the processes undertaken to ensure user privacy which include techniques such as no storage of images, anonymisation of data, and transient image processing on a secure GPU.

**Note that the GeoSpy API is a different model than the free GeoSpy tool. No privacy information specifically regarding the free tool is available.**

Be aware when handling sensitive information.
