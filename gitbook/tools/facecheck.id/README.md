## Description

Reverse image searching for people is a key component of most OSINT investigations. Save photographs of the individuals you are researching, ideally high-resolution images that clearly show their face, and run these through tools like FaceCheck.ID to find more photographs of the same individual. This will help you better understand that person's movements, activities, and associates, and provide you with more research leads.

### Step-by-step guide

Simply drag and drop the image in the search engine. Once the search is complete, FaceCheck.ID will generate a report. Each photograph it has identified has a certainty score between 0 and 100. The search report is deleted after 24 hours, but you can create a permanent link for future reference by clicking on the link below the report.

## Limitations

Like all other reverse facial recognition search engines, FaceCheck.ID will not provide you with a full name, email address and other confirmed pieces of personal identification data. You will need to comb through the results to determine whether a) the images identified by FaceCheck.ID are of your subject, and b) analyse the information on each web page that features the photos to determine information like usernames, possible location etc.&#x20;

## Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations include privacy concerns, copyright infringement, and possible proliferation of misinformation. Make sure you analyse the search results critically and cross-reference these with other sources of information to ensure your findings are accurate. This can help stem misinformation and prevent fake news from spreading. Do not use copyright images without permission.&#x20;
