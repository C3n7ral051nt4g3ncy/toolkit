## Requirements

A web browser and email address are required to sign up for an account and use the tool. If you purchase a membership or subscription, a terminal emulator is required to use the Shodan command-line interface.

## Limitations

The information that Shodan retrieves varies in its efficacy. For instance, the use of a VPN may obscure a device's IP address, as well as change it's apparent geographical location. The service banners that Shodan uses for much of it's information may be limited/trimmed by the service owner.

## Ethical Considerations

Shodan indexes publicly available information, so there is nothing inherently unethical about browsing the results of your searches. Using the tool is akin to walking down a public street and knocking on doors as you pass by. However, using the results of your searches in order to gain (or attempt to gain) unauthorized access to devices is both unethical and illegal in most countries.

## Guide

The Shodan [Help Center](https://help.shodan.io/) contains essentially all of the information you need to know in order to effectively use the tool. This includes:
