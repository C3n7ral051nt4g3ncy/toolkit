## Description

Telemetr.io is a tool that can be useful for journalists and researchers who are interested in analyzing Telegram channels. A database of moderated catalogs that can be sorted by a number of countries and languages and access to many a large number archived messages provide resources for tracking trends, user behavior, and past interactions. Its analysis of message views over different time intervals offers insights into content and engagement. The platform allows for analysis of the level of global and regional activity.

{% hint style="danger" %}
During testing, the author of this review found that the export of data available in the Advanced Plan (and above) is limited to the catalog list of channels. For most metrics described below, you will need API access, which is not included in the plan. (See below at API.)

Further, in the author's testing, reaching someone regarding a refund was challenging, and canceling the subscription was not a straightforward experience.\
Make sure to test the capabilities of the different plans to test which plan you require or contact the sales team to ask for a tailored plan.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
While the free service provides mainly the same data as the paid plans, it is severely restricted in the number of channels you can observe. Since you can only log in via Gmail or Telegram, creating a dedicated login account makes sense when you first try out the tool.

The **Advertising Effectiveness tab** provides metrics for understanding a channel's advertising strategies and their impact. Investigating advertising can help trace funding sources or reveal connections between obfuscated networks of channels. Advertising is an aspect of research often worth looking into and a strength of the platform (compared to free or CLI tools).

<details>

<summary>Advertizing tab metrics in detail</summary>

**Growth within a 24-hour period:** This metric shows the number of new subscribers gained by the channel within the last 24 hours.

A significant increase in subscribers can indicate a successful campaign or a surge in popularity driven by targeted advertising, often in response to specific events.

**Views in 24 hours:** The average number of views per ad post over the last 30 days. This is calculated by dividing the sum of the number of views per ad post per 24 hours by the number of posts over 30 days. This metric reflects the average views of all the channel's ad posts over the last 30 days, not just those from the "Advertising Results" table.

**Advertisings per Day:** The ad frequency on the channel. This measures how often ads are shown on the channel. A lower frequency is generally better, indicating less ad clutter and potentially higher ad impact.

**Average TOP (Time On Page):** The average time an advertisement remains at the top of the channel. A longer duration signifies higher advertising effectiveness, as the ad remains visible for a longer time. This indicates the effectiveness of the content in capturing and maintaining the audience's attention, often through well-funded and strategic advertising.

**Advertised Channels:** The number of promoted channels in the last 90 days. This metric counts how often this channel advertises other Telegram channels, providing insight into the channel's promotional activities. Advertised channels may reveal connections between different hidden networks , showing how they support and amplify each other, particularly around significant events.

**Other Resources:** This metric tracks the number of additional resources or links the channel shares, including links to external websites, documents, or other materials. Sharing valuable resources can enhance the channel's credibility and provide additional context or information to the audience. This can also indicate efforts to drive traffic to other platforms, potentially revealing further connections and funding sources.

**1-hour Growth:** This metric shows the number of new subscribers gained by the advertised channel within one hour of posting the advertisement. It helps assess the immediate impact of the advertisement, indicating how quickly the audience responds to promotional content. Rapid subscriber growth within an hour can signify an effective advertisement or heightened interest due to the timing of the post.

**24-hour Growth:** This measures the number of new subscribers gained by the advertised channel within 24 hours of posting the advertisement. It provides a broader view of the advertisement's effectiveness over a longer period, showing how sustained the audience's interest is beyond the initial exposure. Tracking 24-hour growth helps evaluate the longer-term appeal and reach of the advertisement.

**Mentions in Other Channels:** This metric counts the number of times the advertised channel is mentioned in other channels. It measures the broader reach and influence of the advertisement across the Telegram network. Many mentions in other channels indicate that the advertisement has resonated well beyond its initial audience, suggesting widespread dissemination and potentially coordinated promotion efforts.

**Advertising Post:** This includes the advertisement post's content and its visibility metrics, such as the number of views and the average time users spent on the post (Time On Page or TOP). These details provide information on each advertising post's performance and engagement level. High view counts and longer TOP suggest that the advertisement captured user interest and engaged the audience effectively.

The search results section lists advertisers based on the selected filters. Each advertiser entry includes various metrics and details.

**Metrics and Details:**

1. **Brand Name**: The name of the advertising brand along with a logo or avatar, providing context about the advertiser. Knowing the brand names helps assess the advertisers' credibility and reach.
2. **Views**: The total number of views generated by the advertiserâ€™s posts. High view counts indicate successful ad campaigns and high visibility. This metric helps evaluate the reach and impact of the advertiserâ€™s content.
3. **Mentions**: The number of times the advertiser is mentioned within channels or posts. Many mentions suggest strong brand presence and engagement within the Telegram community.
4. **Channels**: The number of different channels where the advertiser has placed ads. This metric shows the breadth of the advertiser's reach. A higher number of channels indicates a wider advertising network and broader audience targeting.

**Use-cases:**

* **Identifying Coordinated Campaigns:** Researchers can identify patterns suggesting coordinated disinformation efforts by filtering advertisers within specific categories and channels. Frequent advertising in certain categories can reveal orchestrated campaigns to manipulate public opinion.
* **Tracing Financial Backing:** Identify and analyze advertisers with high view counts and frequent mentions to provide insights into their financial backing.
* **Mapping Networks:** Investigating advertiser activity across numerous channels helps understand their reach and influence. This can reveal the structure of larger collaborating channel networks and how they disseminate information across different channels.
* **Evaluating Impact:** Tracking changes in advertising activity over time allows researchers to correlate spikes with significant events. This can reveal how disinformation campaigns are timed and adjusted to maximize impact, potentially providing a strategic understanding of these operations.

### API

This service includes an REST API, allowing users to access data that is programmatically available on the Telemetr.io website. Users must obtain an access key via the @telemetrio\_api\_bot bot to use this API.

The API is designed according to the OpenAPI v3 standard, ensuring compatibility with various programming languages. It offers capabilities such as searching for channels, retrieving basic channel information, accessing channel statistics, viewing channel messages, tracking subscriber changes, and analyzing message reach history. Additionally, it provides dictionaries for languages, countries, and categories.

The API is actively developed, with new data and functionalities planned for future updates. Information on all available paid plans can be found [here](https://api.telemetr.io/docs/intro/overview).

{% hint style="warning" %}
- The free tier may suffice for basic orientation and initial research. Still, its limitations regarding the number of channels observed, search functions, event tracking, and data export make it unsuitable for most investigations.
- The Pro tier offers improvements in ad post tracking and audience analytics, making it a starting point for tentative research, but it is still significantly limited.
- The Advanced tier provides extensive search capabilities and data exports, but the export functionality is still minimal.
- The Enterprise tier, with its fully customizable options, is ideal for large-scale, detailed research projects and institutional needs.
- API access is available to export a limited but larger number of channel metrics, but is priced separately from the main subscriptions.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

* Any modern web browser
* A Telegram account or a Google account (required for searching for channels and for paid services)

## Limitations

* **Access Thresholds:** the free tier only allows analysis of 5 channels per day and only 5 queries for search by posts.
* **Historical Data:** Historical data about Telegram channels or bots is limited to the last 30 days in the Free tier.
* **Real-time Data:** While it offers insights and analytics, there will be a delay in data updates, affecting real-time research and monitoring.
* **API Restrictions:** If you intend to use its free API, you can only access five verified channels, with rate limits of 1000 requests per month and a history of seven days (among other feature limitations).
* **Geographical Coverage:** Some features or data metrics are not fully available or might not be accurate for Telegram channels or bots that operate in specific regions or languages.
* **Mis-categorisation:** some channels have been mis-categorised, so ratings by category should not be taken at face value. (This is especially true for the category "facts".)

Researchers should consider these limitations when deciding whether telemetr.io fits their research needs and objectives.

## Ethical Considerations

When using telemetr.io for research or analysis, ethical considerations should include:

* **Privacy and Consent:** Ensure that data use respects the privacy of individuals and groups. While Telegram channels and bots are public, it's crucial to consider the implications of using or sharing this data without explicit consent.

* **Transparency:** When presenting research or analysis findings, clearly disclose the source of your data and the methodologies used to collect and analyze it.
* **Bias and Fairness:** Acknowledge any potential biases in the data or its collection method that could affect the research outcomes.
