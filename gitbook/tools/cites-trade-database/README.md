# CITES Trade Database

## URL

## Description

The tool hosts million of wild fauna and flora trade records. You can look by year ranges, exporting and importing countries, source, purpose, trade terms (live individuals, skins, etc.) and taxon (genus, species, etc).

You can configurate the kind of results you will get. You can get a csv report with customized configurations or a web version.&#x20;

For example, if you are looking for China imports of wild species for biomedical purposes from 2018 to 2023, you will get a detailed table with over 100 results that gives you species info, importer and exporter info, reported quantity, purpose, source, among other findings.

The tool allows you to bulk download the whole database. With relatively fast internet connection (145.9 Mbps download and 9.92 Mbps upload when I tried) you can get it in under 2 minutes. It is divided into 54 csv archives.

The tool also links the [CITES Wildlife TradeView](https://tradeview.cites.org/en), a interactive online tool for exploring and visualising CITES trade data. You can explore visuals providing in a global view (data of all CITES-listed species), country view (data for one or more countries) and taxon view (data for one or more species or taxonomic groups).

I reviewed the 2024.1 version.

## Limitations

There are some studies that expose some tool limitations, including from the CITES Secretariat, among them:

Sixty-ninth meeting of the CITES Standing Committee ([https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/69/E-SC69-44-02.pdf](https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/69/E-SC69-44-02.pdf))&#x20;

"Information returned by the search function does not lend itself for advanced statistical analysis of trade patterns for sustainability. For example, with the current search function, it is not possible to analyse whether trade in a specimen occurred in one single, large shipment or in multiple smaller shipments, whether the specimen was shipped together with other specimens or whether trade and shipment patterns change over time. Extra information of this kind would be particularly valuable in the context of the Review of Significant Trade."

Michal Berec, Lucie Vršecká, Irena Šetlíková, What is the reality of wildlife trade volume? CITES Trade Database limitations, Biological Conservation, Volume 224, 2018, Pages 111-116, ISSN 0006-3207, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.05.025. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320718303045)&#x20;

• Ninety-six percent of records in the CITES Trade Database were not complete.&#x20;

• Three-quarters of the records missed the quantities from either the importers or exporters.&#x20;

• Mean difference between the maximum and minimum calculated trade volumes was 63 ± 23%.&#x20;

• Trophies were the most problematic form.&#x20;

• Specific changes to improve usability of CITES Trade Database were suggested.

Markéta Slábová, Irena Šetlíková, Magda Vodrážková, Zuzana Richtrová, Michal Berec, The number of shipments in the CITES Trade Database does not accurately reflect the volume of traded wildlife, Biological Conservation, Volume 253, 2021, 108917, ISSN 0006-3207, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108917. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320720309757)&#x20;

• The number of shipments did not reflect traded volume in 15% of vertebrate species.&#x20;

• The volume of frequently traded species cannot be derived from the number of shipments.&#x20;

• More than one-third of the species had a different category of traded volume.&#x20;

• The quantification of trade is sensitive to the data and methods used.

## Ethical Considerations

None so far.
