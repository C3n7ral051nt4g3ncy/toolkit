## Description

RootAbout is a reverse image search tool that processes images from the Internet Archive only. It has a collection of over 37.3 million photos that include “album cover, book cover, or historical NASA photo”, according to its website. RootAbout does not store pictures from the Internet Archive. If the Internet Archive [updates](https://rootabout.com/faq.php) its collection, consequently the results provided by RootAbout will change.

To use the tool, you just need to upload an image of your choice. Under the search option, click on “Internet Archive.” Sometimes, this search option doesn’t work. You can go to the advanced search tab to adjust the size, flip and rotate the image and try again. It is possible to adjust the number of results displayed on the page to a range between five and fifty.

ADD A SECTION ABOUT THE OPENLIBRARY FEATURE HERE

Another useful RootAbout feature is that it provides details about the result image's [metadata](https://rootabout.com/faq.php#What%20is%20RootAbout) after conducting the search, including its type, dimensions, creator, image type, and the year it first appeared, also its description and it informs the user if the result is a strong match.

<summary><strong>Use case</strong> </summary>

For use case, we uploaded the image “Doradus Nebula” since RootAbout mentions NASA [collections](https://rootabout.com/faq.php#What%20is%20RootAbout) as "popular " and which “are in the public domain, they have been reused for album covers, book covers, newsletters, web pages, and more.”

The image is shown below:

The search provided three results. The top-most result with details is shown here:&#x20;

**Note**: While some searches are effective, RootAbout does not work for some photos from the Internet Archive. Images [here](https://archive.org/details/dr_future-map-of-the-world-10902000), [here](https://archive.org/details/speed-1970_20220823_1758), and [here](https://archive.org/details/contact_fingerlakes1_5381) from the Internet Archive are examples. This limitation, along with other shortcomings of the tool, will be discussed under the **Limitation** heading.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

The images must be either in JPEG or PNG format.

## Limitations

* The search is sometimes slow. This is[ because](https://rootabout.com/faq.php) the tool does not pull all the data from the result similar to other search engines. The tool processes a search in six steps, explained[ here](https://rootabout.com/faq.php).
* RootAbout does not always work for images from the Internet Archive. There are various reasons for this. Root About has yet to index/process the image from the Internet Archive. Its[ website states](https://rootabout.com/faq.php), “RootAbout only compares against pictures it has indexed.” Slight changes in scale-invariant, color invariant, edits, cropping, and rotations can prevent the tool from fetching the required results. More details in[ its](https://rootabout.com/faq.php) FAQ.
* RootAbout only indexes the Internet Archive; so [unlike](https://rootabout.com/faq.php#What%20is%20RootAbout) TinEye, Google, and other search engines it “does not look for subsets of images” or “similar subject matter.” Instead, it “looks for near-perfect matches.”
