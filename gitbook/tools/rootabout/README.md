## Description

RootAbout is a reverse image search tool that compares an uploaded image with images from the [Internet Archive](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/internet-archive). RootAbout does not store pictures from the Internet Archive. If the Internet Archive [updates](https://rootabout.com/faq.php) its collection, the results provided by RootAbout will change.

To use the tool, you just need to upload an image of your choice. Under the search option, click on “Internet Archive.” Sometimes, this search option doesn’t work. You can go to the advanced search tab to adjust the size, flip and rotate the image and try again.

ADD A SECTION ABOUT THE OPENLIBRARY FEATURE HERE

A useful RootAbout feature is that it provides details about the result image's [metadata](https://rootabout.com/faq.php#What%20is%20RootAbout) after conducting the search, including its type, dimensions, creator, image type, and the year it first appeared, and its description. It also informs the user if the result is a strong match.

To test the tool, we uploaded the image “Doradus Nebula” from a NASA collection. The image is shown below:

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/root 5.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The search provided three results. The first result is shown here:&#x20;

**Note**: While some searches are effective, RootAbout does not work for all photos from the Internet Archive. For instance, we tested the images [here](https://archive.org/details/dr_future-map-of-the-world-10902000), [here](https://archive.org/details/speed-1970_20220823_1758), and [here](https://archive.org/details/contact_fingerlakes1_5381) and did not get any results despite them being present on the Internet Archive. This limitation, along with other shortcomings of the tool, will be discussed in the **Limitation** section.



## Cost

* [x] Free
* [ ] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

The images must be either in JPEG or PNG format.

## Limitations

* The search is sometimes slow. This is because the tool does not store Internet Archive pictures but it finds them on the Internet Archive via a six step process which is explained [here](https://rootabout.com/faq.php#Why%20is%20RootAbout%20sometimes%20slow).
* RootAbout does not always work for images from the Internet Archive. There are various reasons for this. Root About has yet to index/process the image from the Internet Archive. Its[ website states](https://rootabout.com/faq.php), “RootAbout only compares against pictures it has indexed.” Slight changes in scale-invariant, color invariant, edits, cropping, and rotations can prevent the tool from fetching the required results. More details in[ its](https://rootabout.com/faq.php) FAQ.
* RootAbout only indexes the Internet Archive; so [unlike](https://rootabout.com/faq.php#What%20is%20RootAbout) TinEye, Google, and other search engines it “does not look for subsets of images” or “similar subject matter.” Instead, it “looks for near-perfect matches.”
