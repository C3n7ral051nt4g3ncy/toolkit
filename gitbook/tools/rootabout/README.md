## Description

RootAbout is a reverse image search tool that compares an uploaded image with images from the Internet Archive. It has over [37.3 million pictures](https://rootabout.com/faq.php#What%20has%20RootAbout%20indexed) from Internet Archive collections indexed. However, it does not host photos from the Internet Archive itself.

To use the tool, you just need to upload an image of your choice. Under the search option, click on “Internet Archive.” Sometimes, this search option doesn’t work. You can go to the advanced search tab to adjust the size, flip and rotate the image and try again.

ADD A SECTION ABOUT THE OPENLIBRARY FEATURE HERE

A useful RootAbout feature is that it provides details about the result image's [metadata](https://rootabout.com/faq.php#What%20is%20RootAbout) after conducting the search, including its type, dimensions, creator, image type, and the year it first appeared, and its description. It also informs the user if the result is a strong match.

To test the tool, we uploaded the image “Doradus Nebula” from a NASA collection. The image is shown below:

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/root 5.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The search provided three results. The first result is shown here:&#x20;

**Important note**: Apart from a few exceptions, RootAbout does not work with [photos from the Wayback Machine](https://rootabout.com/faq.php#What%20has%20RootAbout%20indexed). For instance, we tested the images [here](https://archive.org/details/dr_future-map-of-the-world-10902000), [here](https://archive.org/details/speed-1970_20220823_1758), and [here](https://archive.org/details/contact_fingerlakes1_5381) and did not get any results. This limitation, along with other shortcomings of the tool, will be discussed in the **Limitation** section.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

The images must be either in JPEG or PNG format.

## Limitations

* RootAbout only indexes the Internet Archive; so unlike TinEye, Google and other search engines [it does not focus on the whole internet](https://rootabout.com/faq.php#Why%20doesnt%20my%20image%20match).&#x20;
* The tool is also not able to match photos with pictures from the [Wayback Machine](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/internet-archive) which can be a crucial limiting factor for open source researchers.
* The search is sometimes slow. This is because the tool does not store Internet Archive pictures but it finds them on the Internet Archive via a six step process which is explained [here](https://rootabout.com/faq.php#Why%20is%20RootAbout%20sometimes%20slow).
* According to the[ RootAbout website](https://rootabout.com/faq.php#What%20kinds%20of%20pictures%20will%20match), the tool only matches pictures that are nearly identical: "If your picture differs by more than 10%, then it probably won't match. Even simple changes, like cropping an edge or rotating the picture by 5° can be enough to make the picture appear different."&#x20;
