## Description

TelegramDB is a comprehensive search service for Telegram, enabling users to explore and analyze **public** Telegram groups, channels, and user information. Through its dedicated bot, @tgdb\_bot, researchers and casual users can:

1. **Find** public chats (groups and channels) by keyword or name.
2. **Obtain** information about a user’s public presence (e.g., what groups they have joined).
3. **Generate** CSV files of members, cross-group data, or user “nearby” interactions for advanced analysis.
4. **Access** up-to-date statistics on the Telegram network in the TelegramDB database.

Recent improvements include a **redesigned interface** with an **interactive menu** triggered by `/search`, a **better search algorithm** that provides more relevant results, and an expanded database.

#### Commands

The TelegramDB bot (@tgdb\_bot) offers a comprehensive set of commands to help users navigate and utilize Telegram data efficiently. Below is a detailed description of these commands and their functionalities:

<details>

<summary>Full Command Overview </summary>

**Free Commands**

* **/search**
  * Presents an interactive menu allowing you to “Search by title,” “Search by user,” “Search by group,” “Search by channel,” or “Search by bot.”

* **/title \[name]**
  * Search for public groups and channels by a specific title or keyword.

  * Show basic information for a given user, group, or channel. Premium credits unlock more historical details and alerts (e.g., scam or fake flags).

## Cost

TelegramDB uses a **credit-based** model:

* **Free**: Basic searches (up to \~20 results), limited user info.
* **Paid**: Advanced or larger-result commands (e.g., `/where`, `/members`, `/network`, `/near`) require credits.
* **Pricing**:
  * Example tiers: 20 credits \~€1.99, 50+ credits \~€4.99, 100+ credits \~€9.99, etc.
  * In a non-representative convenience sample of searches, prices ranged between 10 and 27 credits with a median price of 14 credits.
  * The **/where** command charges a base 3 credits + 1 credit for every 40 results.
  * The **/members** command uses the formula: **3 + 0.6x^0.8** for x results.

_(Prices and offers may vary; check `/credits` in the bot for current details. Purchases can be made via credit card, Paypal, and cryptocurrencies.)_
