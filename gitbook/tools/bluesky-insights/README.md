## Description

Bluesky Insights is a free web-based analytics platform designed specifically for the Bluesky social network. It provides detailed insights into user activity, engagement trends, and content themes without requiring account authentication. Think of it like a “Social Blade” for Bluesky: a third-party website that lets anyone plug in a publicly available Bluesky handle to see at-a-glance metrics and in-depth data visualizations.

#### **Features & Use Cases**

* **User Analytics**: Track follower growth, engagement rates (likes, reposts, replies), and post-performance over time.
* **Activity Trends**: Identify active posting times, top-performing content, and posting frequency patterns.
* **Word Cloud Analysis**: Automatically generate word clouds to spotlight frequently used terms and hashtags.
* **Trending Hashtags**: Monitor real-time trending topics on Bluesky for emerging conversations or viral content.

#### **Open Source Research Applications**

* **Profile Monitoring**: Analyze public figures, organizations, or suspicious accounts for posting habits and engagement trends.
* **Disinformation Tracking**: Detect potential “coordinated” engagement patterns or sudden spikes in follower counts.
* **Narrative Analysis**: Examine common themes and keywords across user-generated content.
* **Comparative Analysis**: Compare multiple Bluesky accounts to identify similarities in timing, content, or engagement trends.

By enabling external analytics on Bluesky profiles, Bluesky Insights can provide valuable insights for researchers, journalists, and analysts investigating interactions or influence within this decentralized platform.
