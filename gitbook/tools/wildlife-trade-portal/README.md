## Description

This tool helps researchers explore and visualize wildlife trade seizures around the world by filtering by individual incidents or events. You can search by species, countries involved and dates. An advanced search allows you to include incidents involving organized crime and corruption, people, specific locations and taxonomic characteristics of species. As a result you will get charts and visuals that enable you to explore incidents by countrie, year, taxonomy, commodity type, category (for example, seizure or enforcement action), transport method, trade routes and transit type (airport, road, etc), plus a results page with a list of the incident, a map page that locates incidents in the countries involved, and other charts that you can reproduce and modify depending on what you need, for example, you can see the number of people by government involvement over time or the number of incidents by type of transit over time. You can also search for multiple species. In this way, you can find incidents related to each species and incidents related to all the species you are looking for. Results can be exported.

You can contribute to this site by providing the source, the date, the country of the incident, any associated countries on the trade route, any associated species, the type of commodity, and the quantity of commodity of a seizure of which you are aware.

There are two other tools within this one. The first is an interactive and visual web platform that provides timber trade data, called TimberStats. The second is a web tool for visualizing trade data sets as trade flow arrows on a map, called TradeMapper. These sites are independent, but you must register on the Wildlife Trade Portal to use and explore them.

Within this tool there are two other instruments. These sites are independent, but you must register on the Wildlife Trade Portal to use and explore them.

The first is an interactive and visual web platform called TimberStats. This site allows you to explore timber trade data from the UN Comtrade database via API. It offers an Annual Trade Statistics Dashboard, where you can explore trade flows around the world and search by products, values, net weight, HS codes among other metrics, and an Annual Trade Discrepancies Dashboard, where you can find inconsistencies in reported trade between two countries.

The second is a web tool for visualizing trade data sets as trade flow arrows on a map, called TradeMapper. You can upload your data in CSV format and create interactive maps with the information, which will also help you analyze it. Wider arrows indicate more trade volume and the colored dots show the countries' role along the route. Depending on your location, you will need a VPN in the UK to access it.&#x20;
